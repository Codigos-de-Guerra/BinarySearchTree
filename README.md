# Binary Search Tree

## Introduction

As requested by our professor at the subject Estruturas de Dados Básicas ([EDB2](https://sigaa.ufrn.br/sigaa/public/departamento/componentes.jsf)), at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte ([UFRN](https://ufrn.com.br)), we shall implement a binary search tree, which is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). Not only that, we must also add some useful methods, besides the standards ones.
